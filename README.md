## Pythonic Monopoly

* *When completing the dashboard, I had thought the goal had been to recreate the Dashboard as closely as possible to the one on the original ReadMe file, and later realized that we were supposed to take a more creative approach.  That being said, I have elected to make the following adjustments regarding formatting:*  
* Rebuilt the following 3 charts using HvPlot (previously Pandas plot function):
  * "Housing Units in San Francisco from 2010 to 2016"
  * "Average Rent in San Francisco"
  * "Average Sale Price per Square Foot in San Francisco"
* Made adjustments within each chart's code to better fit the dashboard's space.
* Capitalized the *N* in neighborhood to improve the aesthetics of the following chart:
  * "Average Prices by Neighborhood"
* The .mov file was too large to display on the project's ReadMe, so I installed the ffmpeg package using Homebrew to convert it to a gif.  
  * Please see the gif/movie demonstration below:
